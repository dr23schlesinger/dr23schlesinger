ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Tre Schlesinger, Associate Professor and Director of Graduate Studies in Sociology at DePaul University.
My research examines the role of state criminalizing and punishing systems in the maintainance of white supremacy in the contemporary United States.
Currently, I'm collaborating with the Community Justice Exchange and local bail bonds in seven jurisdictions to examine the expansion of non-financial conditions of pretrial release.
